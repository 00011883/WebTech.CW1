## Project's Future Developments and Visions

Currently, [Characters Page](https://00011883.netlify.app/pages/characters/index.html) of the website contain only 4 agents out of 17 characters.
So, for the next development release, there will be added horizontal gallery system. Moreover, there will be items those will show clicked agent abilities
and contain bries information about them.

Next, feature that available in all pages, namely Theme Changer needs improvements. Or rather, the adjustment of color schemes for a light and dark theme.

Lastly but not lease, regarding [News](https://00011883.netlify.app/pages/news/index.html) and [Shop](https://00011883.netlify.app/pages/shop/index.html) pages,
